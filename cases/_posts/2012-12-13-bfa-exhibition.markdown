title: "BFA Senior Exhibition: Pictures Worth Countless Words"
---

It was held in the Colonel Eugene E. Myers Art Gallery in the Hughes Fine Art Center on the University of North Dakota campus from November 26-29. Entitled "Pictures Worth Countless Words", I recreated well-known photographs<!--more--> using only type, which was generated from my research of each particular photograph. Articles, interviews, accounts, and even diary exerpts were the building blocks of my final designs. I received tremendous feedback and couldn't have been more pleased with the outcome.

Each of the five images are 20x28 and took approximately 15 hours to create. I painstakingly placed each word or character into the image, thus reconstructing the famous photograph the text was about.
