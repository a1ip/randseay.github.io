title: "Fall Intramurals 2012 Campaign"
---

In this campaign I worked with the RecSports coordinator at the UND Wellness Center to increase both interest and awareness of the upcoming intramural sports. I utilized old photographs<!--more--> taken of intramural sports throughout the years at the University, and wrote clever copy to correspond with each one. This project was largely successful, creating and implementing the motto "Why would you want to sit out?" and proving to be a fresh and humorous way to engage students, faculty, and staff. It was distributed across campus in a variety of sizes and medias such as large posters, flyers, and screens. This was a very enjoyable project to envision, strategize, carry out, and deploy.
