[Anderson-Crain Investment Group](http://anderson-crain.com/) is a private equity real estate company that is active in the Midwest, Southwest, and Northeast markets<!--more-->. At [Skosh](http://skosh.io), we had the pleasure of working with them to put together a logo and color scheme on which the could build their brand. The final result is a clean, competent, and professional look that helps them stand out in their field at a critical stage in their growth.

Anderson-Crain is an organization that emulates integrity and professionalism, and their logo needed to do the same. The version of the logo that ended up winning out is a sturdy design of four blocks, with one letter in each block. The words are set in a serif font, in small caps.

## Brand Overview

In addition to designing the logo and creating a full logo set, we felt it important to provide a brand overview, detailing the color formulas and general guidelines regarding the utilization of the logo.
