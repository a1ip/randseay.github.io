In this campaign I worked with the University of North Dakota Health & Wellness Hub to create a noticeable campaign centered around engaging facts regarding alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs<!--more-->. The goal of the campaign was to target all students, faculty, and staff and decrease the consumption of the substances emphasized. The consistent look and feel of materials created a buzz and interest, causing viewers to stop and read the content when new facts came out. This Campaign was distributed across campus in a variety of sizes and medias such as large posters, flyers, screens, and window clings. Overall, it was a very successful and engaging campaign.
