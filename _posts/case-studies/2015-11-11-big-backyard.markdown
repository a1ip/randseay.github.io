I was first contacted about this project in May 2015, and was asked to design a sign to promote a series of outdoor events the church was hosting. The sentiment behind the project was very apparent from the first meeting we had, and the name "Big Backyard" stuck like glue<!--more-->. It was immediately clear to me that this project was suitable for more than just a sign planted on the lawn, and that the church's goals for engaging the neighborhood could be translated successfully into a small campaign involving fliers, postcards, door hangers, and digital designs. Their budget was small for this project, but I didn't mind giving away some of my time if it came to that.

## An Engaging Idea

The "Big Backyard" idea has many positive vibes to it. Inclusion. Intimacy. Laughter. Games. Inviting people to a backyard event shows intentionality, and is less intimidating. There would be good food, socializing, and events for kids. In fact, I could see myself bring my own family to this sort of thing (We went :smiley:).

I pulled out my camera and started in my own backyard, my loyal sheltie following me out the back door. It was a beautiful summer day, and my kids playthings were strewn about. A soccer ball. A Cozy Coupe. It was perfect and I started shooting.

## Forming a Concept

Satisfied with the shots, I conceptualized the design and settled on the typeface *Chalkduster* for my display text. It fit the playful mood, and wasn't too over the top (in small doses, that is). In my first concept, the other design elements were going to be laid over an image, and include small graphics and clean typography. There was very little back and forth with the client and no need for additional concepts because they loved the first one I sent.

    It wasn't what we were envisioning, but it captured the idea perfectly.

This event happened once a week for four weeks, with a different theme for each one. They were "Things That Fly", "Things That Bounce", "Things That Are Wet", and "Folk Night". Materials were needed to encompass the event as a whole, but also digital screens that would highlight the particular theme of each week and be displayed on the projector each service.

## Final Thoughts

This event was fun to work on and a blast to participate in. From start to finish, the aim was to be welcoming and lighthearted. It was well attended, and will continue to be held annually. Nailing the first concept was nice, but that doesn't always happen. Thanks for checking out this case study!
