The University of North Dakota Health and Wellness Unit consists of many different branches, and was in need of strong brand to unify it. Consisting of the Health & Wellness Hub<!--more-->, Student Health Services, the University Counseling Center, the Wellness Center, Work Well, and Financial Wellness, the unit offers a wide variety of services and fills many different roles. I created a consistent look and feel for materials in which the entire unit was represented, as well as a branding element to be used on individual promotional materials, tying it to the rest of the unit.
