deck: "The University of North Dakota Wellness & Wellness Unit is comprised of many different branches, which lacked cohesion when described visually together. I implemented a typographical take on its visual identity."

The University of North Dakota Health and Wellness Unit consists of many different branches, and was in need of strong brand to unify it. Consisting of the Health & Wellness Hub<!--more-->, Student Health Services, the University Counseling Center, the Wellness Center, Work Well, and Financial Wellness, the unit offers a wide variety of services and fills many different roles. I created a consistent look and feel for materials in which the entire unit was represented, as well as a branding element to be used on individual promotional materials, tying it to the rest of the unit.
