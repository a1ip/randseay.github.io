The University of North Dakota Homecoming Spirit Run was a 1.5 mile, 5K, and 10K family walk/run hosted by the UND Wellness Center. In this project I worked closely with the event coordinator, and handled nearly all<!--more--> the design work associated with it. This included developing the logo and branding the entire event. On the print side there were posters, flyers, table tents, route maps, handouts, T-shirts, and banners, including a parade banner and Start and Finish Banners. The Spirit Run was also promoted campus-wide using screens, web sliders, and both the Health & Wellness Unit and the Wellness Center Facebook page with customized Cover design. The event was very successful, and well, looked good.
