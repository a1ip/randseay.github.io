It was held in the Colonel Eugene E. Myers Art Gallery in the Hughes Fine Art Center on the University of North Dakota campus from November 26-29. Entitled "Pictures Worth Countless Words", I recreated well-known photographs using only type, which was generated from my research of each particular photograph. Articles, interviews, accounts, and even diary exerpts were the building blocks of my final designs. I received tremendous feedback and couldn't have been more pleased with the outcome.

Each of the five images are 20x28 and took approximately 15 hours to create. I painstakingly placed each word or character into the image, thus reconstructing the famous photograph the text was about.

The first is the Flag Raising at Iwo Jima

The second is the Tank Man
