title: "2016: More Transitions!"
---

2015 has felt extraordinarily busy, but in an everyday grind kind of way. Jessica finished up her Masters Degree in Social Work :tada::smile::+1:, so our year has been consumed by making time for her to do internship and independent study project, coordinating childcare, and trying to give each other breaks from demanding children<!--more-->. It has been trying, but we could not be more proud of our momma! She worked insanely hard and has managed the early stages of another pregnancy marvellously &mdash;all while inching closer and closer to her dream of leading groups.

As we dive into the new year, I will be starting a new position at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) &mdash;an awesome company based out of San Francisco. The interview process I went through was fantastic, and I could not be more excited to be part of such a talented team of professionals. A huge draw for me was their remote work culture, so I will be adjusting to working from home now. I have received some sound advice on what it looks like to adjust to this type of work style, but will have to learn on my feet what it looks like practically for us.
