                    I was formally educated at the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://und.edu">University of
                    North Dakota</a>, where I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts
                    in Graphic Design &amp; New Art Media. After a successful
                    start as a graphic designer for the great ad agency,
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://admonkeys.com">Ad
                    Monkeys</a> in Grand Forks, ND, I dove headlong into
                    learning web development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Passionate about perfecting my craft, I took a position with
                    the <a href="http://cts.ndus.edu" target="_blank">North
                    Dakota University System Core Technology Services</a> as a
                    Web Applications Developer in 2013. Additionally, I became a
                    father and cofounded
                    <a href="http://www.skosh.io" target="_blank">Skosh
                    Interactive, L.L.C</a> the same year. Besides full stack
                    development and IT Consulting, we have helped clients
                    through designing logos, building websites, and establishing
                    their brands.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I built and maintain a mobile-first front-end framework
                    called <a href="http://fuselage.skosh.io">
                    Fuselage</a>, which is built on Sass and aimed at structural
                    composability. With no javascript dependencies, it is a
                    great starting place for nearly all of my projects.

                    My wife and I, with our two kids, dog, and cat live in Grand
                    Forks, ND. I love disc golf, grilled meat, tinkering in my
                    woodshop, and learning new things.

                <h2>Technologies</h2>

                <p>
                    I am quite picky about my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and am
                    very comfortable with CSS preprocessors like
                    <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> and
                    JavaScript libraries like
                    <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>. I
                    learn frameworks like
                    <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">
                    Foundation</a>,
                    <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">
                    Bootstrap</a>, or
                    <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node</a>
                    quickly, and love picking up new things
                    â€“<a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">
                    Angular</a>,
                    <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">
                    React</a>, etc. I love tools like
                    <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a>,
                    <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a>, and
                    <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a>, and
                    work almost exclusively on the command line. I speak Bash
                    and may or may not have
                    <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/dotfiles">
                    spent a ton of time customizing my Zsh prompt</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've spent a lot of time working in ColdFusion, Python,
                    MySQL, and PostgreSQL. I prefer Git, especially on
                    <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}" target="_blank">
                    GitHub</a>. I think Vim is pretty cool, but am most
                    comfortable with Sublime Text as a text editor. I dig Macs
                    or other flavors of Unix, but am comfortable with Windows
                    (though I will never forgive Internet Explorer).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm at home with mockup or charting software such as
                    <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a>
                    or <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com" target="_blank">
                    Lucidchart</a>, and love using the Adobe Creative Suite (
                    Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop). I've done a fair bit of
                    photography, and am particular when it comes to writing
                    copy.
